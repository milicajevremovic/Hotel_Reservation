My final work which I want you to review is in Java, because I have submitted two repositories, so for revising and testing my work take a look into "Hotel Reservation Java" repository. I wrote this boking program in Java and in C#. Also, I have attached my C# repository, and wrote partial program (without testing), but had some problems with launching test units in .NET so i switched to writing in Java.
