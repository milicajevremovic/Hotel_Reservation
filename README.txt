My final work which I want you to review is in Java, because I have submitted two repositories, so for revising and testing my work take a look into "HotelBookingJava" repository. I wrote this "Hotel Boking" program in Java and in C#. Also, I have attached my C# repository, and wrote partial program (without testing), but had some problems launching testing in .NET so i switched to writing in Java.
