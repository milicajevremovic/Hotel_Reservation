My final work which I want you to review is in Java, because I have submitted two repositories, so for revising and testing my work, take a look into "Hotel Reservation Java" repository. Also, I have attached my C# repos, and wrote partial program (without testing) but had some problems with launching test units in .NET so I switched to writing in Java.
